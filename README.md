This repository contains the MSc Management consultancy project proposal and supporting materials for a study on Deloitte UK's talent retention and ESG integration challenges.

## 1. Project Overview

This project develops a consultancy style research proposal that investigates how Deloitte UK can improve talent retention while strengthening the integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into its operations and client work. The work is based on secondary data and is aligned with the
Consultancy Project Proposal assessment brief at BPP University.

## 2. Research Focus

- **Client organisation:** Deloitte UK  
- **Core issues:**  
  - Persistent talent shortages, burnout and retention risk in the UK consulting labour market  
  - Increasing pressure for credible ESG strategies, disclosures and net zero commitments  
- **Overall aim:**  
  To investigate and propose strategies for improving talent retention and the integration of ESG principles within Deloitte UK.

### Research objectives

1. Evaluate current talent retention strategies at Deloitte UK.
2. Analyse the integration of ESG principles within Deloitte UK's organisational culture and client operations.
3. Identify key challenges and opportunities for improving both talent retention and ESG integration.

### Research questions

1. How can Deloitte UK enhance its talent retention strategies to address current challenges in employee engagement and satisfaction?
2. What are the key barriers and opportunities for Deloitte UK in integrating ESG principles into its corporate strategy and operations?

## 3. Methodology

The project uses a **qualitative secondary research design**.

- **Design:** Exploratory descriptive single organisation study  
- **Data type:** Existing documents and datasets only  
- **Key sources:**  
  - Peer reviewed journal articles (2019 to 2025)  
  - Deloitte UK annual and sustainability reports  
  - Big Four and industry insights (BCG, McKinsey, CIPD etc.)  
  - UK labour market and ESG regulatory reports  
- **Analysis:**  
  - Thematic analysis to group findings into key themes such as burnout, skill shortages and ESG compliance  
  - Comparative analysis and benchmarking against sector and Big Four trends  
  - Qualitative synthesis and validation of findings across multiple UK specific sources  

The research plan is summarised in a flowchart which moves from identifying the research problem, through literature search, screening and quality evaluation, thematic and comparative analysis, qualitative synthesis, validation of findings and final conclusions.
